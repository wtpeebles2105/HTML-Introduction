        <h1 class="header1"> Basic's of Coding</h1>
          <h2 class="header1"> Understanding code </h2>

            <p class="definition"> Code is basically the concept of giving commands to a computer so that will execute those commands in the exact order you put them in.</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> What is HTML? </h2>

            <p class="definition"> HTML stands for <b><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C1NHXL_enUS706US706&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=Hypertext+Markup+Lanuage"> Hypertext Markup Lanuage</a></b>. It is widely used on internet pages along with javascript.</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> How code works on the internet </h2>

            <p class="definition"> The internet is made up of tons of <b>HTML</b> pages which are linked together with a protocol called <em><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=HTTP">HTTP</a></em>. When browsing from your computer you use the internet to pull HTML pages from repositories such as servers.</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> Tags and Elements </h2>

            <p class="definition"><em>Elements</em> are what make up HTML documents. <em>Tags</em> are the way we tell the computer which elements we are using in our code.</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> Inline and Block Elements </h2>

            <p class="definition"> There are two types of elements in an HTML file. <b>Inline</b> happen inside the current line you are coding in. <b>Block</b> elements form an "invisible box" around the contents which can cause undesired breaks in sentences.</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> Void Tags </h2>

            <p class="definition"> Void Tags are tags that don't require a closing tag such as the <b>"img"</b> tag.</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> Break vs Pargraph </h2>

<!-- I got a little bold here and decided to try putting breaks inside of paragraphs.....I think it worked? -->

        <p class="definition"> Paragraph is a block element. It puts an invisible box around text and wraps the text as needed. Break is an inline element. When using breaks it stops on its current line right after you close it.<br>

        Resulting<br>in<br>text<br>like<br>this.</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> Whitespace </h2>

        <p class="definition"> Whitespace is the area between words.But <em>HTML</em> removes that and turns it into a single space. This makes more sense when looking at  this sentence in its source. </p>

        <h1 class="header1">  HTML and CSS </h1>
          <h2 class="header1"> Webpages and Boxes </h2>

            <p class="definition"> All web pages are made of boxes, we may not see those bozes depending on the way it is styled using CSS but at the core of every webpage is a series of boxes we load with content for the end user to read</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> Developer's Tools </h2>

            <p class="definition"> A tool you can use on most web browsers to see the structure of the page you're looking at. It's great when you're trying to figure out how to replicate a style of layout that you would like to implement in one way or another. (which I used a lot when I was younger trying to spice up my old myspace page)</p>

          <h2 class="header1"> CSS </h2>

            <p class="definition"> <em>CSS</em> stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>, it allows the prgrammer to control the look and style of the HTML elements. IF you want certain paragraph to be red you can simply make a rule for it in the CSS file.</p>

          <h2 class="header1">Adding images to a Page</h2>
<!---There was probably a better way to do what I did next, but I just kept playing with div boxes until I got the desire effect I wanted-->
        <div class="hyperbox">
          <p class="definition">
            <div class="box">Adding images to a page is easily done by linking to its location.
              <div class="img">
                <img src="images/code.png" alt="Should be a picture of random code here">
              </div>
            </div>
              <p class="box1text"> You can also use the flex command to make different boxes line up if you'd like your text beside your photo instead </p>
            <div class="img">
              <img src="images/code.png" alt="Should be a picture of random code here">
            </div>
        </div>
      </div>
</html>
